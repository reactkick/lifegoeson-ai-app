# To get started with Dependabot version updates, you'll need to specify which
# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.

The Python code you've provided calculates the sum of the first 50 prime numbers. Let's break it down and execute the logic step-by-step to compute the result.

### How it works:
1. `is_prime(n)` determines whether a number `n` is prime:
   - Returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1.
   - Iterates through numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` to check divisibility. If divisible, it's not a prime.

2. The `primes` list stores the first 50 prime numbers.
   - Starts with `num = 2` and adds numbers to the list if they are prime, using `is_prime()`.

3. Once 50 primes are found, their sum is calculated using `sum(primes)` and printed.

Let's run the code to determine the sum of the first 50 prime numbers.
